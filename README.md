# Week_14
## Overview of the statistical analysis:
We looked at data of Citi bike and create visualizations that can be used to get a clearer picture of bike use. We used the data to make visualizations of most attractive ride start and stop locations, bike rental broken down by gender, breakdowns of the most popular times to ride a bike, and many other useful graphs.

## Summary
We found many things from the data. For example, there are many more male riders than female riders. Additionally, the majority or rides are less than 1 hour long. Using the maps we are able to see the most popular pick up and drop of points in the city. We were also able to find the best time to do maintenace on bikes was between 2 and 5 am as these are the least popular times to rent a bike. In the future we could look at which starting locations are most popular for which genders. Additionally we could look to see ride duration based on customer type.
